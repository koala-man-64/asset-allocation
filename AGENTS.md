# AGENTS.md instructions for /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation

## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- architecture-review-agent: Audit architecture and code for cloud-native reliability, security, operability, and performance. Use for architecture reviews or delivery-readiness audits requiring an Architecture & Code Audit Report and actionable work items. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/architecture-review-agent/SKILL.md)
- code-hygiene-agent: Apply safe, behavior-preserving lint and refactor changes for readability and conventions. Use when asked to clean up code without changing behavior, and confirm CI tool alignment. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/code-hygiene-agent/SKILL.md)
- delivery-engineer-agent: Implement production-ready, testable code changes and cloud-native deployment-ready config. Use for feature or bug delivery tasks requiring an Implementation Report with operational readiness. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/delivery-engineer-agent/SKILL.md)
- delivery-orchestrator-agent: Hybrid orchestrator + scrum master + tech lead that scopes requests into work items, routes to the right agents, enforces gates (review/QA/security/devops), prevents loops/thrash, maintains single-source-of-truth status/ledger, and outputs an Orchestrator Update. Use when coordinating multi-agent delivery, managing handoffs, or deciding Done/Rest for work items. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/delivery-orchestrator-agent/SKILL.md)
- frontend-design: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality and a clear aesthetic point-of-view. Use when asked to design/build or restyle any web UI (components, pages, dashboards, landing pages, posters/artifacts, or full apps) in React/Next/Vite/HTML/CSS, including typography, color systems, layout composition, and motion. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md)
- gateway-bookkeeper: Enforce MCP-first tool usage through a centralized gateway/bookkeeper: discover MCP capabilities, route intents to the best MCP tool, block non-MCP execution when an MCP equivalent exists, and log all tool calls/results with auditable fallbacks. Use when building or operating a multi-agent system where agents must not access tools/networks directly and all actions must be policy-enforced and recorded. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/gateway-bookkeeper/SKILL.md)
- project-workflow-auditor-agent: Audit a repository/project for security practices, CI/CD workflow safety, adherence to project instructions (AGENTS.md/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY), and consistency across code/config/docs. Use when preparing for release, reviewing GitHub Actions workflows, enforcing engineering guardrails, or assessing delivery readiness and governance. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/project-workflow-auditor-agent/SKILL.md)
- qa-release-gate-agent: Risk-based testing, verification, and CI/CD quality gating. Use when asked to test or verify changes, create test plans, review CI/CD workflows, or assess release readiness. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/qa-release-gate-agent/SKILL.md)
- technical-writer-dev-advocate: Turn engineering work into clear, accurate, usable documentation and developer enablement assets (quickstarts, how-to guides, concept docs, API reference, samples, runbooks, troubleshooting, release notes, migration guides) with evidence-backed traceability. Use when creating/updating docs from source code/specs/tests, auditing docs for correctness and gaps, or preparing PR-ready docs changes that reduce support load and speed time-to-first-success. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.agent/skills/technical-writer-dev-advocate/SKILL.md)
- architecture-review-agent: Audit architecture and code for cloud-native reliability, security, operability, and performance. Use for architecture reviews or delivery-readiness audits requiring an Architecture & Code Audit Report and actionable work items. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.codex/skills/architecture-review-agent/SKILL.md)

(file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.codex/skills/delivery-orchestrator-agent/SKILL.md)
- forensic-debugger: Use for evidence-first technical investigations of system failures spanning applications, infra, networking, DBs, CI/CD, and distributed services. (file: /mnt/c/Users/rdpro/Projects/AssetAllocation/.codex/skills/forensic-debugger/SKILL.md)
- frontend-design: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality and a clear aesthetic point-of-view.

### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
